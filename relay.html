        <h2>Relay Info</h2>
        <p>Many events through our club require an entry fee, this is usually to cover the costs of 
        <br/>
        running them, however the rest of the money goes toward our Relay for Life team.

      <h3>About Relay for Life</h3>
      <p>Relay is a team fundraising event where team members take turns walking around a track or designated path.<br/>
        Each event is 6-24 hours in length and each team is asked to have a member on the track at all times to signify that cancer never sleeps.<br/> 
        Cancer patients don't stop because they're tired, and for one night, neither do we.<br/><br/>

        Each team sets up a themed campsite at the event and continues their fundraising efforts by collecting donations for food, goods, games, and activities.<br/> 
        This money will count towards their overall team fundraising goal.</p>

        <h3>Where Money Goes</h3>
        <p>Any profit generated by this club goes towards a collective club total.<br/>
          As relay approached all profits will be divided among members of the club <br/>
          who are part of a Relay for life team. There are costs to running the club <br/>
          though. Many events cost money in oder to set up so first priotrity goes to <br/>
          paying back these costs<br/>
